    <h1 class="question">Who are you?</h1>
    <p class="answer">
       I'm <b>Cameron Fife!</b> I'm a studying computer
       scientist at Brigham Young University in
       Idaho. I used to be a student at Boston
       University, but I wasn't very happy so I 
       made the choice to come live here where I
       felt I had more friends.
    </p>
    <h1 class="question">Do you like it here?</h1>
    <p class="answer">
       Yes! I love it here! I may transfer again, but
       only if I think I'm ready. BYU-Idaho feels like
       the perfect place to grow. I have a supportive 
       community and great teachers. Again, I still may
       transfer but only if I feel I'm ready again for the
       environment out there. It's a little more industrious
       and a requires a little more independence.
    </p>
    <h1 class="question">What are you favorite topics in CS?</h1>
    <p class="answer">
       There's a lot I still want to learn. I'm really excited
       about databases and machine learning. In terms of subjects
       I've already taken, my favorite class has definitely been
       Data Structures. I've taken several online courses on my own 
       that also cover data structures. I just think the topic is 
       overall very fun and applicable to programming. Computer 
       Systems is likewise fascinating. I'm currently taking 
       Computer Architecture.

    <h1 class="question">Are you Single?</h1>
    <h4 class="answer"><i>*sigh*</i></h1>
    <p class="answer">
       Yes. But because of an influx of requests from girls who want me to 
       be their boyfriend, I'm currently not taking requiests. Please send your
